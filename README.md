## Indian Railways Announcement System

A project to demonstrate how we can generate the Railways Station Announcement by maintaining a database of required information regarding the trains in an excel sheet.
What actually done in this project is that, 
* First of all we had to record the sample announcement of any of the train from the railway station, 
* Or we can also download the sample announcement from the internet. 
* And then trimming the recorded sound of the train no., train name, source & destination, platform on which train is arriving, and so on.
* to make possible, insertion of the external generated voice by api according to our database in between trimmed position of the recording.
